    Dashboard built using Evidence showing Duck metrics.
    Dashboard generation is declared via an asset
    Source queries are downloaded locally and cached as parquet
    Static HTML/JS web pages built for high performance leveraging duckdb and WASM.
    This isnt really to do with data and its a bit of a hack to do a bit of CICD locally.
    example over at: https://github.com/dagster-io/devrel-project-demos/blob/main/motherduck-dagster-hybrid-compute/motherduck_dagster_hybrid/assets.py#L239

    For demos still using `npm run dev` instead of waiting for static files to be built (webpack budling ect)

    *TODO ðŸš§ also getting an error: `FATAL ERROR: Ineffective mark-compacts near heap limit Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory` but succeeding in dagster.
